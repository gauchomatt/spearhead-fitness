								<div class="name">Coach Dallin Frampton</div>
								As a resident of Holladay, Utah, Dallin, and his beautiful wife, Carlyn, are the Owners of SpearHead
								Fitness. Dallin is an avid runner, mountain biker, rock climber, triathlete, mountaineer, skier,
								surfer and adventurer. He has participated in 2 marathons and a handful of triathlons, 2 of which he got
								1st and 2nd place in his age group. He has also run the Wasatch Back relay four different times,
								competed in 12 half marathons and ridden the White rim trail 4 different times, 3 of the attempts were
								under 16 hours. When he was training to tryout for the USA amateur triathlon team in 2009, Dallin was
								introduced to CrossFit and began coaching athletes just 18 months later. Not only does he enjoy the
								competent and measurable aspect of CrossFit, but Dallin also has an amazing passion for his athletes and
								the completion of their goals through fitness, nutrition and life.<br><br>

								After graduating in 2008, he raised over $10,000 to build a school in the village of Dzivani, just
								outside of Mombasa, Kenya. After he received funding from CrossFit Headquarters to build another school,
								Coach Greg Glassman brought him on board to work for CrossFit HQ staff and Dallin is now Project Lead on
								this effort to build schools, water cisterns, desks and the like in rural Kenya, and also oversees all
								of the philanthropic work CrossFit HQ takes part in. Besides letting his adrenaline lead him through
								life, he also loves music and has been playing guitar for over 9 years.<br><br>

								During the Fall months of 2011, Dallin was able to meet the woman of his dreams and in June 2013, he was
								married to his beautiful and amazing bride, Carlyn Frampton, and they now are able to run a gym full of
								passionate, spirited people that they love coaching every single day. Dallin is so grateful to have such
								a hard-working and spirited elite-athlete like Carlyn supporting him in everything he does, especially
								when it comes to running the gym!

								<div class="name">Coach Carlyn Frampton</div>
								Hello, SpearHead Community! My name is Carlyn Frampton, Co-Owner of SpearHead Fitness with my husband,
								Dallin Frampton. I am an obsessed CrossFitter, a recreational runner, mountain biker and rock climber
								and a loving daughter, wife and coach.<br><br>

								I am a resident of Holladay, Utah and absolutely love everything about my life. I have a loving Husband,
								amazing family members, an incredible job and a supportive community around me in everything that I do.
								What could be better than that, right?!<br><br>

								Dallin and I met back in 2011 after he took me on a midnight Millcreek Canyon/Pipeline trail run as our
								first date. We dated for a few years before we were engaged and soon to be married. Quickly, I was
								immersed in his life that included working for CrossFit Corporate in Kenya-based philanthropic efforts
								as well as the crazy thought of opening a CrossFit gym. The rest is history, obviously, and because we
								both loved to exercise, we decided to open the doors of Spearhead Fitness in 2013 on the premise that
								helping other people achieve their goals, both in and out of the gym, is the single most important role
								any gym owner can play.<br><br>

								I have now been CrossFitting competitively since 2012 on an elite-level and always look for
								opportunities to further my competitive edge through both local and Open-style competitions. Competing
								at Regionals has always been a dream of mine and I can’t wait to get there this year! I have completed
								the Wasatch Back Ragnar relay multiple times, competed in dozens of half marathon races as well as raced
								in a handful of road bike events.<br><br>

								I couldn’t run the gym without Dallin and Dallin could DEFINITELY not run the gym without me! We both
								play such an integral part in ensuring every one of our clients have a second-to-none experience and you
								can absolutely bet that the next time you are working out with me, I will be cheering you on until I am
								blue in the face! I love everything that SpearHead stands for and I can’t wait to be your Coach!

								<div class="name">Coach Chris McNerney</div>
								Born and raised on the east coast, I moved to Salt Lake City in 2012 after getting out of the Navy.
								Within the first year of living here, I discovered CrossFit and fell in love with it immediately. The
								community, along with the mental and physical aspects of uncovering the dark sides about yourself-was
								something that drew me to it even more.<br><br>

								I was attracted to this so much, that I wanted to try and share that with other people. Having had my
								own personal obstacles and challenges related to health and wellness, coaching has been my way to give
								back and share that with other people. I pride myself on quality over quantity and the preservation of
								longevity in all aspects of my life, but mostly with fitness. Having had to bounce back from a
								significant knee injury in the last year myself, I understand the challenges associated with slowing
								down and refining movement patterns.M<br><br>

								Currently, I am finishing up my degree at the University of Utah in Kinesiology & Nutrition. In my free
								time, fitness, mountain biking, ice hockey, traveling and spending time with friends and family is what
								keeps me busy.

								<div class="name">Coach Scot Neff</div>
								Scot Neff is thrilled and honored to be a coach at Spearhead Fitness. He has been a Salt Lake resident
								most of his life and is currently the Director of Zermatt Resort’s Sports Academy. In 2015, Scot
								graduated with his Masters of Business Administration with an emphasis in Entrepreneurship at
								Westminster College. In 2011 he graduated with his Bachelors in Economics from the University of Utah.
								During his undergraduate, Scot earned a spot on the A side roster of the U of U’s Rugby team where he
								learned discipline, grit, and leadership skills. He is happily married to the love of his life and
								currently has two amazing boys that brighten their lives daily. Scot is an avid outdoorsman and loves
								spending time fly fishing, skiing, hiking, diving, snowmobiling, horseback riding, and hunting.<br><br>

								Due to a skiing accident, Scot had a crippling back injury. He felt like he could no longer do the
								things he loved. He was always in pain, unsure of himself, and felt helpless. After trying just about
								every type of exercise and fitness to aid Scot’s recovery, he had a rugby teammate tell him to try
								CrossFit. That was in October of 2013 and today he is stronger, faster, fitter, and overall happier than
								he has ever been before.<br><br>

								Coming from someone who at one point couldn’t sit through a movie, ride in a car, jump, or tie his own
								shoes, Scot is a true believer in CrossFit. The functional movement and fitness behind CrossFit
								strengthens the human body in ways one cannot comprehend. It is all about taking things slow, and
								growing one step at a time. There is something beautiful about doing hard things, CrossFit will make a
								person do just that. As a coach, Scot’s strengths are pushing athletes to the next level and helping
								them get through their own ‘pain caves’. He believes that by pushing through self-doubt and weakness the
								output will be positive for both body and mind. If one hasn’t tried Spearhead Fitness, do it! It will
								change all facets of life for good.

								<div class="name">Coach Luke Smith</div>
								Luke was born and raised in Salt Lake City only a few blocks away from the gym. He grew up playing team
								sports such as football, lacrosse and rugby but as he grew he gravitated more toward individual sports
								and really fell in love with the martial arts in 2009. Since then he has competed in a number of amateur
								level grappling tournaments and mixed martial arts fights. He also currently serves in the US Army
								reserve and loves taking care of his soldiers and helping his squad accomplish their missions. If Luke
								were to have a mission statement it would be as follows; "stack the odds in your favor to live a long
								and healthy life."" Crossfit teaches, and Luke affirms that physical strength and conditioning are
								essential to living long and enjoying life.

								<div class="name">Coach Summer Andrus</div>
								I fell in love with the mountains of Salt Lake when I moved out here from St. Louis to attend the
								University of Utah. I took up rock climbing, river rafting, trail and road running, hiking, backpacking
								and eventually swimming, and road and mountain biking. In 2004 I discovered triathlons and began
								competing in sprint, olympic, half, and eventually full Ironman distances. In 2008 I started coaching
								triathlon training, running, swimming, and spin courses at the University of Utah for the Exercise &amp;
								Sports Science department. I loved helping students achieve their goals, overcome challenges, try new
								things and find themselves doing things they never thought they could do. There’s a rush that comes with
								being a part of that journey. I also spent a few years working with spinal cord injury (SCI) patients at
								the University of Utah Rehabilitation center. While most of my duties were administrative, I had the
								absolute joy and pleasure of working with SCI outpatients in the TRAILS (Therapeutic Recreation &amp;
								Independent Life Styles) program. With adaptive equipment we helped people learn how to cross-country
								ski, downhill ski, kayak, handcycle, and participate in marathon handcycle divisions with what body and
								muscular function remained post-injury. I’ve also spent time working with teenagers including teaching
								high school health, coordinating and teaching in a secondary education program for teenagers struggling
								with mental illnesses, and earning my Master’s in Public Health with an emphasis in health
								communications and adolescent health. I can’t think of a better fit for the rollercoaster of teenage
								life than a CrossFit program and I’m excited to be a part of it.<br><br>

								I’m the lucky wife to a loving husband, a mother to two incredible boys, an outdoor enthusiast, a life
								long learner, a seeker of good, a great cook, a Mandarin speaker, an athlete, and, dare I say, a donut
								lover. After having kids and finding I no longer had ample hours to maintain my triathlon training,
								CrossFit helped restore the athlete in me and keeps me on a road to the highest level of general fitness
								I can achieve, an ongoing journey where today I can be better than yesterday. Plus, it’s just fun! And
								you can’t beat the SpearHead community.

								<div class="name">Coach Katie Graham</div>
								I began working out the first time that leg warmers were cool ;) when the heaviest thing a girl should
								pick up was a 5lb hand weight. I’ve seen every work out trend (and enjoyed most all of them!) including
								step aerobics, distance running, spin, Triathlon training, yoga, TRX... basically you name it I’ve tried
								it. After working many years to ‘get in shape’ or ‘stay in shape’ I’ve learned so many great things
								about not only fitness, but about the amazing way our body is designed to move and the responsibility we
								each have to learn how to keep it moving without pain over long periods of time.<br><br>

								The best way to do this is with a little daily effort and a little self discipline. And of course, the
								education to know what to do and when.<br><br>

								In 2013 I began to use CrossFit as my daily workout, and soon after discovered that Mobility, which is
								movement that repairs muscle fibers and prepares your body to move more comfortably, makes working out
								not only more enjoyable, but much more sustainable. This, for me, was like the missing link of fitness!
								I’ve been a mobility junky ever since, and have sought out any opportunity to learn about this aspect of
								fitness and how to share it with others.<br><br>

								In January of 2015 I completed the mobility course with CrossFit HQ, and in November 2015 became a level
								1 CrossFit coach. During the first half of 2016 I worked to obtain a 200 hour yoga teacher training
								certificate, which has served to round out my passion for mobility and movement.<br><br>

								When not enjoying the gym I am working to enjoy my family and serve in my church. I love working out
								with and being a partner to my husband John. Together we enjoy (?) the chaos of raising 6 children, 1
								dog and 9 chickens. In any moments to spare we love serving in the refugee community and spending time
								with amazing people like those at Spearhead Fitness.
